Alrighty we're just going to get right into it. I was told going into this unit that it would lead up to a very difficult project. The subject matter would be challenging, and it would have its moments of frusteration. It all proved to be correct as many a time sitting in front of my computer trying to best my new nemisis known as "params" I wanted nothing more than to throw many full bottles of wine at my laptop screen.

However, what eventually got me through it was knowing that the answer was out there somewhere and it was up to me to figure out how to do it. It would depend on my knowledge of not only how to code, but where and how to look for answers I didn't have, it was a test of my resourcefulness.

This project relied on my creative abilities. I had to decide what I wanted out of it, what I wanted it to look like, and then how to make it happen. With the NFL season coming to a close I decided that Fantasy Football would be the inspiration behind my project. An application that allowed you to create your favorite players and than edit their team if they got traded or even what posiotion they played. I'm pretty sure that all of us would like to see Tom Brady as a running back, the dude runs like a baby giraffe.

Paths and forms were the biggest challenge in creating this project. Creating the migrations and the "belongs to/has many" relationship was simple. But building the paths proved to be more difficult. I had to makes sure all tha paths were closed to not get an error (I had many) and to make sure any links I added to my forms would smoothly transition to the next one.

Althought the subject matter on thsi project was more difficult than when I built my API gem, it was easier to navigate this project than the last one because of building on prior experince. I can only hope it continues this way as I am onto Rails.
